## Troubleshooting

### Interactive Input Issues (Password Input) üîë

#### Problem: No response when entering password
```
First time user! Please set a new master password.
Enter new master password: [Seems like input doesn't work here]
```

**Cause:** Interactive input in Docker container may not work properly in Windows PowerShell

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Interactive-only Script (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   docker-run-secure-interactive.bat
   
   # Linux/macOS
   ./docker-run-secure-interactive.sh
   ```

2. **Use Direct Docker Command:**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --name binance-trader-secure \
     --security-opt no-new-privileges:true \
     --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=100m \
     binance-trader-secure
   ```

3. **Use Windows Terminal:**
   - Use Windows Terminal instead of PowerShell
   - Provides better interactive support

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- üîê **Password input is not displayed on screen but is being entered**
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Type slowly and accurately, then press Enter**
- üîÑ **Password confirmation must be entered identically**
- üí° **Cursor may not move during input but this is normal**

### Docker-related Issues

#### Container Name Conflict Error
```
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/binance-trader-secure" is already in use by container "...". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
```

**Cause:** Previous container remains, preventing creation of new container with same name

**Solutions:**

1. **Delete existing container and run new one (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Force delete existing container
   docker rm -f binance-trader-secure
   
   # Run again
   ./docker-run-secure-interactive.bat
   ```

2. **Connect to existing running container:**
   ```bash
   # Connect to running container
   docker exec -it binance-trader-secure /bin/bash
   
   # Or run program directly
   docker exec -it binance-trader-secure ./build/binance_trader
   ```

3. **Check existing container status:**
   ```bash
   # Check container status
   docker ps -a | findstr binance-trader-secure
   
   # If running: STATUS shows "Up"
   # If stopped: STATUS shows "Exited"
   ```

4. **Restart stopped container:**
   ```bash
   # Start stopped container
   docker start binance-trader-secure
   
   # Connect after start
   docker exec -it binance-trader-secure ./build/binance_trader
   ```

5. **Complete cleanup and fresh start (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Delete all related containers
   docker rm -f binance-trader-secure
   
   # Also delete image if desired
   docker rmi binance-trader-secure
   
   # Run fresh
   ./docker-run-secure-interactive.bat
   ```

**üí° Simplest Solution:**
```bash
docker rm -f binance-trader-secure && ./docker-run-secure-interactive.bat
```

#### Docker Desktop Execution Error
```
error during connect: Get "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/v1.48/..."
```
**Solution:**
1. Check if Docker Desktop is running
2. Run "Docker Desktop" from Windows Start menu
3. Check Docker whale icon in system tray
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for Docker Desktop to fully start

#### Docker Compose Version Warning
```
the attribute `version` is obsolete
```
**Solution:** Already fixed. Version attribute is unnecessary in latest Docker Compose.

### Compilation Errors

#### C++ Reserved Word Conflict
```
error: 'signed' specified with 'bool'
```
**Solution:** Already fixed. Changed `signed` parameter to `is_signed`.

#### OpenSSL Header Error
```
fatal error: openssl/pbkdf2.h: No such file or directory
```
**Solution:** Already fixed. Removed unused headers.

### Direct Compilation Issues
- Check if OpenSSL and libcurl are properly installed
- Check if pkg-config can find libraries
- Check Visual Studio Build Tools installation (Windows)

### API Errors and Trading Failures

#### Problem: Buy/sell orders not executing
```
Do you really want to buy? (y/N): y
Executing buy order...
Order failed: [Error message]
```

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Insufficient API Key Permissions**
   - Check API key settings in Binance
   - Verify **Spot Trading** permission is enabled
   - Check if **Enable Trading** option is checked

2. **IP Restriction Settings**
   - Check IP restrictions in Binance API management
   - Verify current IP address is in allowed list
   - Or disable IP restrictions (not recommended for security)

3. **Insufficient Balance**
   - Check if USDT balance is sufficient for purchase amount
   - Minimum purchase amount: approximately $1-2 (varies with current BTC price)

4. **Below Minimum Order Quantity**
   - Minimum order quantity: 0.00001000 BTC
   - Check minimum order amount based on current BTC price

5. **Network Connection Issues**
   - Check internet connection status
   - Check if firewall blocks Binance API access

6. **Market Conditions**
   - Check if not during trading suspension time
   - Check if not during Binance server maintenance

**Debugging Methods:**

1. **Use Order Permission Test (Menu 8)**: üîß
   ```
   === Order Permission Test ===
   Test order permissions without actual trading.
   
   Testing buy permission...
   ‚úÖ Buy permission: Normal
   Testing sell permission...
   ‚úÖ Sell permission: Normal
   
   üéâ All order permissions are normal! Actual trading is possible.
   ```

2. **Check API Response**:
   - Check "API Response" messages during program execution
   - Check specific error codes and messages
   - Look up error code meanings in Binance API documentation

3. **Detailed Permission Check**:
   - Trading permission status automatically checked at program start
   - Check Binance settings when "‚ùå Trading Permission: Disabled" message appears

**Additional Checks:**
- Verify API key and secret key are correct
- Check if account has sufficient balance
- Verify it's actual account, not testnet

### Network Errors
- Check internet connection status
- Check firewall settings
- Check Binance API server status

## File Storage Locations

### Encrypted Key Files

**Docker Normal Mode:**
- Host system: `./data/keys.enc`
- Inside container: `/app/data/keys.enc`

**Docker Enhanced Security Mode:**

- Inaccessible from host

**Direct Execution:**
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.binance_trader\keys.enc`
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.binance_trader/keys.enc`

This file is encrypted with master password and cannot be decrypted without the password.

```

**Enhanced Security Mode:**
```bash
# Run in background
docker-compose -f docker-compose-secure.yml up -d

# Connect to running container
docker-compose -f docker-compose-secure.yml exec binance-trader-secure /bin/bash

# Stop container
docker-compose -f docker-compose-secure.yml down

# Delete container and images
